Introduction to modelling.

These tutorials will teach you about the main methods used in computational modeling of behavior, inspired from the steps structured in Wilson & Collins (2019) eLife, Ten simple rules for the computational modeling of behavioral data. Tutorials are structured in the following way: 

1A: Model definition and estimation (2h, tutorial_1A.ipynb)
1B: Model fitting, model validation, parameter recovery, parameter uncertainty (bootstrapping) (2h, tutorial_1C.ipynb)
1C: Model selection, cross-validation, model recovery (2h, tutorial_1C.ipynb)

Each tutorial is accompanied by a solution file. Slides presenting the concepts for each tutorial are available in the slides_lecture folder.

Authors: Alexandre Hyafil, Marion Rouault, Klaus Wimmer.
