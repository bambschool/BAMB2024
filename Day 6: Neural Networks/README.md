# Part I: Feedforward models

 In the first part of the tutorial, we will learn how to use Perceptron and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks to solve simple classification tasks. We will walk through the necessary steps to implement and train these networks using PyTorch. Here is the index:
 
- Imports.
- Models:
  * Perceptron.
  * Multi-layer perceptron.
- Generate data.
- Training and evaluating.
- Playing


# Part II: Recurrent Neural Networks

In the second part of the tutorial we will learn how to use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to solve a Perceptual Decision Making task. Here is the index:

- Installs, packages, auxiliary functions.
- Preparing for the training:
  * Training parameters.
  * Define the task (sample dataset).
  * Define the network.
  * Define the algorithm to train the network.
  * Save config.
  * Supervised training of the RNN.
  * Run the trained network (and save the behavioral data).
- Network analysis:
  * Behavioral analysis.
  * General neural analysis.
  * Stimulus and choice decoding from network activity.
