# Fitting RL models to data

Welcome to Part 2 of the RL tutorial. In this tutorial, we will learn about how to properly fit RL models to data.

This tutorial is currently a copy of that from BAMB2023 where it was adapted from [Collins and Wilson (2019) eLife](./docs/WilsonCollins2019TenRulesForModelFitting.pdf). The paper is an excellent read and we highly recommend that you go through it in detail in your own time.

Two main python notebooks are provided:
- [`tutorial_2B_RL_instructions.py`](./tutorial_2B_RL_instructions.ipynb) has the instructions, and
- [`tutorial_2B_RL_instructions.py`](./tutorial_2B_RL_instructions.ipynb) has the solutions.
 
Feel free to look at [`RL_library.py`](./RL_library.py), which contains a number of pre-coded functions useful for the tutorial.
